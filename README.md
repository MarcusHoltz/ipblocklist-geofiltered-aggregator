## üõ¥ Install

Set up your own copy of this repository to aggregate and filter your IP blocklists for multiple countries.

* * *

### üëÜ Click the green "Use this template" button in the upper right corner

         
1. **Sign in** to GitHub and navigate to [this repository](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator).
2. Click the **"Use this template"** button (in the upper right corner).
3. Select **Create a new repository**. Enter a name (e.g., `my-eu-badip-blocklist`), and confirm.
4. Your new repository is now independent ‚Äî it will not share commit history with the original.
5. You can immediately begin editing or configuring it for your own multi-country IP aggregation project.

> The **"Use this template"** button on GitHub allows you to quickly create a new, independent repository pre-populated with the project's files and structure. Your new repository won't inherit commit history from the template. This is perfect for your personal blocklist repo.

*Usage is below for steps on running this repository with Github Actions in your new IP aggregation project.*


## üõ† Usage

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)

#### First Step - Enable Write Permissions

1. **Enable Actions**: Go to Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions
2. **Set Permissions**: Select "Read and write permissions", click "Save".


#### Second Step - Configure The Repo

3. **Configure Environment**: Edit `.env` file with your desired sources and countries
4. **Your Favorite Blocklists**: Load as many blocklists as you like, just make sure the line starts with `LIST1_`, `LIST2_`, `LIST3_`, etc.
5. **Multiple Countries**: Countries can be modified the same way, `COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_1`, `COUNTRY_NAME_1`, `COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_2`, `COUNTRY_NAME_2`, etc.
6. **Find Country Codes**: You can find your country codes in the [geoip2-ipv4 spreadsheet](https://datahub.io/core/geoip2-ipv4)
7. **Automatic Runs**: The workflow runs twice daily. At both **02:17 AM/PM UTC** or it will run anytime if you [modified the cron file](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/.github/workflows/ip-aggregation.yml)


#### Third Step - Running This Action

8. **Run This Now**: You can run this Github Action by using the "Action" tab up top
9. **Generate Multi-Country Blocklists**: Under "All workflows" you can find this action
10. **Run workflow**: On this page, off to the right is a button with a dropdown to "Run workflow"
11. **Off to the races**: Each run will consume some of your free monthly Github Actions 2000 min (33.3 hours)

> Please adjust cron, it is how often your aggregator runs in [.github/workflows/ip-aggregation.yml](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/.github/workflows/ip-aggregation.yml), also modify your blacklists and countries in the [.env](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/.env) file.

## ‚öô Configuration

### üåç Multi-Country Setup

The `.env` file supports multiple countries:

```bash
# European Union Example
COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_1=DE
COUNTRY_NAME_1=Germany

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_2=FR
COUNTRY_NAME_2=France

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_3=NL
COUNTRY_NAME_3=Netherlands

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_4=IT
COUNTRY_NAME_4=Italy

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_5=ES
COUNTRY_NAME_5=Spain
```

This will generate:
- `aggregated-de-only.txt` (Germany IPs)
- `aggregated-fr-only.txt` (France IPs) 
- `aggregated-nl-only.txt` (Netherlands IPs)
- `aggregated-it-only.txt` (Italy IPs)
- `aggregated-es-only.txt` (Spain IPs)
- `aggregated-multi-5countries-combined.txt` (All countries combined, deduplicated)

### Sample .env file

```bash
# Add your IP list sources
LIST_1=https://example.com/blocklist1.txt
LIST_2=https://example.com/blocklist2.txt

# Set multiple countries (NEW FEATURE!)
COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_1=DE
COUNTRY_NAME_1=Germany

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_2=FR  
COUNTRY_NAME_2=France

# Configure paths (usually don't need to change)
GEOIP_CSV_PATH=/data/geoip/geoip2-ipv4.csv
ALL_IPS_FROM_LISTS=/data/output/aggregated.txt
```

## üè† Local Deployment (Alternative)

If you'd rather download this repo and run this project offline, the instructions are below:

### 1. Clone the repository

The first step is to download the files from the internet, and get them locally on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator.git
```

### 2. Configure your sources and countries in .env

The next step is to configure the project to your liking. Edit your `.env` file. You can enter as many IP based block lists as you need and configure multiple countries.

```bash
nano .env
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

You can now run the project and see what happens.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Check results

Let's see what happened!

```bash
ls -la data/output/
```

## üìÅ Output Files

### Per-Country Files
- `data/output/aggregated-{country-code}-only.txt` - Country-specific IPs (e.g., `aggregated-de-only.txt` for Germany)

### Combined Multi-Country Files  
- `data/output/aggregated-multi-{number-of-countries-total}countries-combined.txt` - Combined IPs from all countries (deduplicated)
- Example: `aggregated-multi-3countries-combined.txt` for Germany + France + Netherlands

### Core Files
- `data/output/aggregated.txt` - All deduplicated IPs from all sources (before country filtering)
- `data/output/stats.md` - Comprehensive processing statistics with per-country breakdowns

## üîÑ Workflow Triggers

The GitHub Action runs automatically when:

- **Daily Schedule**: Every day, twice. Once at at 02:17 AM UTC and then again at 02:17 PM UTC
- **File Changes**: When `.env`, `Dockerfile`, or key scripts are modified
- **Manual Trigger**: Via GitHub Actions interface


## üßπ Starting With Clean Output

If you're going to customize the list: 

- You should remove the [./data/output](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/data/output) folder, as it will only contain data pertinent to the last run.

- Always remove the [./data/output](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/data/output) folder when you customize the countries. 

> This will ensure you dont include older, unused countries in your new aggreagtion lists.

## üëç Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the amazing work of the following other projects:

* * *

### üé© Datopian

Thank you to [Datopian](https://github.com/datasets/geoip2-ipv4) for maintaining the [GeoIP2 IPv4 dataset](https://datahub.io/core/geoip2-ipv4). This dataset provides otherwise impossible information for IP geolocation, allowing this project to filter IPs based on multiple countries simultaneously.

- [GeoIP2 IPv4 Dataset](https://datahub.io/core/geoip2-ipv4) by Datopian is essential for filtering and identifying IP addresses across various countries, enabling the dynamic multi-country functionality of this project.


* * *

### ü¶ò Andrew Twin

Special thanks to [Andrew Twin](https://github.com/andrewtwin) for creating and sharing the [IP Aggregator](https://github.com/andrewtwin/ip-aggregator) project. Andrew's work on efficiently aggregating IP blocklists was a fundamental inspiration and foundation for this enhanced multi-country version.

- The [IP Aggregator](https://github.com/andrewtwin/ip-aggregator) allows easy downloading, parsing, and filtering of multiple IP blocklists, which this project leverages and extends for multi-country IP management tasks.


* * *

### üìó Blocklist maintainers

I would like to additionally acknowledge the maintainers and contributors of various [IP blocklists](https://github.com/topics/ip-blocklist) and [IP blacklists](https://github.com/topics/ip-blacklist). Thank you for maintaining up-to-date, community-driven threat intelligence that forms the foundation of generating these multi-country filtered files. While the specific lists in this repo may vary, the collective dedication to improving online security and privacy of all contributors is deeply appreciated.
