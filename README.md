## 🛴 Install

Set up your own copy of this repository to aggregate and filter your IP blocklists for multiple countries.

* * *

### 👆 Click the green "Use this template" button in the upper right corner

         
1. **Sign in** to GitHub and navigate to [this repository](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator).
2. Click the **"Use this template"** button (in the upper right corner).
3. Select **Create a new repository**. Enter a name (e.g., `my-eu-badip-blocklist`), and confirm.
4. Your new repository is now independent — it will not share commit history with the original.
5. You can immediately begin editing or configuring it for your own multi-country IP aggregation project.

> The **"Use this template"** button on GitHub allows you to quickly create a new, independent repository pre-populated with the project's files and structure. Your new repository won't inherit commit history from the template. This is perfect for your personal blocklist repo.

*Usage is below for steps on running this repository with Github Actions in your new IP aggregation project.*


## 🛠 Usage

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)

#### First Step - Enable Write Permissions

1. **Enable Actions**: Go to Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions
2. **Set Permissions**: Select "Read and write permissions", click "Save".


#### Second Step - Configure The Repo

3. **Configure Environment**: Edit `.env` file with your desired sources and countries
4. **Your Favorite Blocklists**: Load as many blocklists as you like, just make sure the line starts with `LIST1_`, `LIST2_`, `LIST3_`, etc.
5. **Multiple Countries**: Countries can be modified the same way, `COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_1`, `COUNTRY_NAME_1`, `COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_2`, `COUNTRY_NAME_2`, etc.
6. **Find Country Codes**: You can find your country codes in the [geoip2-ipv4 spreadsheet](https://datahub.io/core/geoip2-ipv4)
7. **Automatic Runs**: The workflow runs twice daily. At both **02:17 AM/PM UTC** or it will run anytime if you [modified the cron file](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/.github/workflows/ip-aggregation.yml)


#### Third Step - Running This Action

8. **Run This Now**: You can run this Github Action by using the "Action" tab up top
9. **Generate Multi-Country Blocklists**: Under "All workflows" you can find this action
10. **Run workflow**: On this page, off to the right is a button with a dropdown to "Run workflow"
11. **Off to the races**: Each run will consume some of your free monthly Github Actions 2000 min (33.3 hours)

> Please adjust cron, it is how often your aggregator runs in [.github/workflows/ip-aggregation.yml](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/.github/workflows/ip-aggregation.yml), also modify your blacklists and countries in the [.env](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/.env) file.

## ⚙ Configuration

### 🌍 Multi-Country Setup

The `.env` file supports multiple countries:

```bash
# European Union Example
COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_1=DE
COUNTRY_NAME_1=Germany

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_2=FR
COUNTRY_NAME_2=France

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_3=NL
COUNTRY_NAME_3=Netherlands

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_4=IT
COUNTRY_NAME_4=Italy

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_5=ES
COUNTRY_NAME_5=Spain
```

This will generate:
- `aggregated-de-only.txt` (Germany IPs)
- `aggregated-fr-only.txt` (France IPs) 
- `aggregated-nl-only.txt` (Netherlands IPs)
- `aggregated-it-only.txt` (Italy IPs)
- `aggregated-es-only.txt` (Spain IPs)
- `aggregated-multi-5countries-combined.txt` (All countries combined, deduplicated)

### Sample .env file

```bash
# Add your IP list sources
LIST_1=https://example.com/blocklist1.txt
LIST_2=https://example.com/blocklist2.txt

# Set multiple countries (NEW FEATURE!)
COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_1=DE
COUNTRY_NAME_1=Germany

COUNTRY_ISO_CODE_2=FR  
COUNTRY_NAME_2=France

# Configure paths (usually don't need to change)
GEOIP_CSV_PATH=/data/geoip/geoip2-ipv4.csv
ALL_IPS_FROM_LISTS=/data/output/aggregated.txt
```

## 🏠 Local Deployment (Alternative)

If you'd rather download this repo and run this project offline, the instructions are below:

### 1. Clone the repository

The first step is to download the files from the internet, and get them locally on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator.git
```

### 2. Configure your sources and countries in .env

The next step is to configure the project to your liking. Edit your `.env` file. You can enter as many IP based block lists as you need and configure multiple countries.

```bash
nano .env
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

You can now run the project and see what happens.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Check results

Let's see what happened!

```bash
ls -la data/output/
```

## 📁 Output Files

### Per-Country Files
- `data/output/aggregated-{country-code}-only.txt` - Country-specific IPs (e.g., `aggregated-de-only.txt` for Germany)

### Combined Multi-Country Files  
- `data/output/aggregated-multi-{number-of-countries-total}countries-combined.txt` - Combined IPs from all countries (deduplicated)
- Example: `aggregated-multi-3countries-combined.txt` for Germany + France + Netherlands

### Core Files
- `data/output/aggregated.txt` - All deduplicated IPs from all sources (before country filtering)
- `data/output/stats.md` - Comprehensive processing statistics with per-country breakdowns

## 🔄 Workflow Triggers

The GitHub Action runs automatically when:

- **Daily Schedule**: Every day, twice. Once at at 02:17 AM UTC and then again at 02:17 PM UTC
- **File Changes**: When `.env`, `Dockerfile`, or key scripts are modified
- **Manual Trigger**: Via GitHub Actions interface


## 🧹 Starting With Clean Output

If you're going to customize the list: 

- You should remove the [./data/output](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/data/output) folder, as it will only contain data pertinent to the last run.

- Always remove the [./data/output](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/ipblocklist-geofiltered-aggregator/edit/main/data/output) folder when you customize the countries. 

> This will ensure you dont include older, unused countries in your new aggreagtion lists.

### 🎩 Datopian

Thank you to [Datopian](https://github.com/datasets/geoip2-ipv4) for maintaining the [GeoIP2 IPv4 dataset](https://datahub.io/core/geoip2-ipv4). This dataset provides otherwise impossible information for IP geolocation, allowing this project to filter IPs based on multiple countries simultaneously.

- [GeoIP2 IPv4 Dataset](https://datahub.io/core/geoip2-ipv4) by Datopian is essential for filtering and identifying IP addresses across various countries, enabling the dynamic multi-country functionality of this project.

### 🦘 Andrew Twin

Special thanks to [Andrew Twin](https://github.com/andrewtwin) for creating and sharing the [IP Aggregator](https://github.com/andrewtwin/ip-aggregator) project. Andrew's work on efficiently aggregating IP blocklists was a fundamental inspiration and foundation for this enhanced multi-country version.

- The [IP Aggregator](https://github.com/andrewtwin/ip-aggregator) allows easy downloading, parsing, and filtering of multiple IP blocklists, which this project leverages and extends for multi-country IP management tasks.

### 📗 Blocklist maintainers

I would like to additionally acknowledge the maintainers and contributors of various [IP blocklists](https://github.com/topics/ip-blocklist) and [IP blacklists](https://github.com/topics/ip-blacklist). Thank you for maintaining up-to-date, community-driven threat intelligence that forms the foundation of generating these multi-country filtered files. While the specific lists in this repo may vary, the collective dedication to improving online security and privacy of all contributors is deeply appreciated.
